//! Onboarding rehearsal.
//!
//! A developer aid for experiencing first-run onboarding on a machine where
//! jcode is already set up. Alt+5 (reset), Cmd+5 (toggle), `/onboarding-sim`,
//! or `jcode --onboarding-sim` start it.
//!
//! The rehearsal runs the REAL onboarding flow: the same phases, key handlers,
//! timers, login detection, import, and start choice a brand-new user gets. The
//! only thing it changes is that jcode forgets it already knows this user:
//!   - the flow starts as if this were a first launch,
//!   - login detection lists every importable login from other tools on this
//!     machine, including ones jcode already trusts (a fresh install would
//!     not know about that trust yet).
//!
//! It stays safe because the real flow itself is safe to re-run: importing a
//! login jcode already has keeps the existing login (no re-sign-in, no revoked
//! trust), "Log in to OpenAI" skips the sign-in when OpenAI is already
//! connected, and onboarding never rewrites an existing telemetry choice. The
//! one rehearsal-only guard is that a telemetry choice made here is not saved.
